### Environment Variables :

    KUMA_PASSWORD: The password of your Uptime Kuma user

Additional configuration variables available

### Example :

You can simply create a docker compose file like this :

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  kuma:
    container_name: uptime-kuma
    image: louislam/uptime-kuma:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - uptime-kuma:/app/data

  api:
    container_name: backend
    image: medaziz11/uptimekuma_restapi
    volumes:
      - api:/db
    restart: always
    environment:
      - KUMA_SERVER=http://kuma:3001
      - KUMA_USERNAME=test
      - KUMA_PASSWORD=123test.
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
    depends_on:
      - kuma
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

volumes:
  uptime-kuma:

### In order for the example to work: You have to run kuma first then create your kuma username and password then re-run the compose file.
